# Powercast Electricity Challenge by Lunor AI

The challenge was about 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 using real data from SMARD, with the models designed to be use in a commercial dApp.

Since this was my first time joining a challenge like this, my main goal was simply to take part and gain experience. I had no expectations of ranking, so it was a great surprise to finish in the top 10 out of 69 participants and be part of the prize pool!

Thanks to Lunor AI and Ocean Protocol for putting these challenges and pushing the community to keep raising the bar.
